# 🧠 Loqa Hub

[![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/loqalabs/loqa-hub/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/loqalabs/loqa-hub/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Central orchestrator for the Loqa local-first voice assistant platform.

## Overview

Loqa Hub is the core service that handles:
- gRPC API for audio input from pucks
- Speech-to-text processing via Whisper.cpp
- LLM-based intent parsing and command extraction
- NATS integration for publishing commands to other services
- **NEW:** Complete voice event tracking and observability

## Features

- 🎤 **Audio Processing**: Receives audio streams from puck devices via gRPC
- 📝 **Speech Recognition**: Local speech-to-text using Whisper.cpp
- 🤖 **Intent Parsing**: Natural language understanding via Ollama LLM
- 📡 **Event Publishing**: Publishes parsed commands to NATS message bus
- 🔒 **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally, no cloud dependencies

### 🆕 Milestone 2: Observability & Event Tracking

- 📊 **Voice Event Tracking**: Every interaction generates structured events with full traceability
- 🗄️ **SQLite Storage**: Persistent event storage with optimized performance (WAL, indexes)
- 📝 **Structured Logging**: Rich context logging with Zap (configurable JSON/console output)
- 🌐 **HTTP API**: RESTful endpoints for event access and debugging
- 🔍 **Audio Fingerprinting**: SHA-256 hashing for deduplication and analysis
- ⏱️ **Performance Metrics**: Processing time tracking throughout the voice pipeline
- 🚨 **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error state capture and reporting

## Architecture

The Hub service acts as the central nervous system of the Loqa platform, orchestrating the flow from voice input to actionable commands. With Milestone 2, all voice interactions are now fully traceable with structured events stored in SQLite and accessible via HTTP API.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LOQA_HUB_PORT` | `3000` | HTTP server port |
| `LOQA_GRPC_PORT` | `50051` | gRPC server port |
| `DB_PATH` | `./data/loqa-hub.db` | SQLite database file location |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Logging level (debug, info, warn, error) |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | `console` | Log output format (json, console) |
| `OLLAMA_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama API endpoint |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `llama3.2:3b` | Ollama model for intent parsing |
| `NATS_URL` | `nats://localhost:4222` | NATS server URL |

### API Access

The Hub exposes a RESTful API for accessing voice events:

- `GET /api/voice-events` - List events with pagination and filtering
- `GET /api/voice-events/{uuid}` - Get specific event details
- `POST /api/voice-events` - Create events (testing/integrations)

See [`API.md`](API.md) for complete endpoint documentation with examples.
